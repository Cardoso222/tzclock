# TZClock

A timezone clock is a macOS utility that displays the current time in multiple timezones, providing a quick and convenient reference for users who frequently work or communicate across different regions. This utility typically appears as a compact icon in the top bar of the macOS interface, allowing users to easily access and view the time in various locations without the need for additional applications or manual calculations.
